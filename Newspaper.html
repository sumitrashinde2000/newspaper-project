                 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the murder happened after a group clashed over a petty issue during the Hanuman Jayanti programme in the taluk on Sunday night. Police have initiated a probe and taken a few people into custody for inquiry, it is said. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condemning the murders and blaming the ruling Congress party for it, the Opposition BJP had constituted two fact-finding teams to look into the murder of the 'Yuva Brigade' member in T Narasipura taluk and the alleged murder of a Jain monk in Belagav...
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the murder incident took a twist after it was found that one of the accused was said to be the brother of a BJP corporator in Mysuru City Corporation.</p>
